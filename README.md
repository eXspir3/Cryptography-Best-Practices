# Java-Cryptography-Best-Practices

As *cybersecurity* gets more relevent every day and examples of *secure Implementations* are often hard to come by -
this Repo aims to get some Best-Practice-Implementations of common and secure Cryptography Algorithms in Java out there.

Only well-known / secure Libraries or the Standard-Libraries are used.
I aim to choose secure Paremters for the Cryptographic Functions and also explain them in the comments.

Currently the following Crypto-Algo-Implementations are finished and to my best knowledge secure to use:

## Asymmetric-Encryption:
* RSAAsymmetricEncryption - RSA-4096-OAEPWithSHA-512AndMGF1Padding

## As you may have noticed this repo is work in Progress as only the RSAAsymmetricEncryption.java is currently finished.
